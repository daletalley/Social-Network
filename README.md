## Description

This application is a social network API built using MongoDB and Mongoose. It allows users to create a user profile, add friends, and share thoughts. Users can also react to other users' thoughts and add comments to thoughts. The application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The application is deployed to Heroku with MongoDB Atlas for the database. The application is not deployed to GitHub Pages because it is not a front-end application, but a back-end one. The application can be tested using Insomnia Core. The walkthrough video demonstrates the functionality of the application.

## Demonstration

## Technologies Used

This application is built using Node.js and Express.js, along with JavaScript, MySQL, and Sequelize as an ORM tool. It also incorporates Handlebars as a template engine. The application depends on various node package manager (npm) dependencies such as sequelize, mysql2, express, dotenv, nodemon, bcrypt, bootstrap, connect-session-sequelize, express-handlebars, and express-session. For future unit testing, Jest is included in the setup. Additionally, the Insomnia application is used for testing the functionality of the routes within the program.
